  It’s a Monday afternoon, and Brew Dog on Devonshire Street in Sheffield is mostly empty. Ryan Lewis, dressed in plaid, has his portfolio open on a table next to one of their ales. He talks about his background—he studied fine art at university, and is classically trained as a painter.
</p>
<p>
You can see this in his portfolio, or at least in part of it. There are oil paintings of characters from Alice in Wonderland, detailed drawings of creatures from the Harry Potter and Pokémon universes.
</p>
<p>
But the highlights of the portfolio are the bold, colourful, graphic designs Ryan has done for his clients from craft breweries.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, Lewis Ryan decided to put his artistic skills to work as a graphic designer. As a great lover of beer, he sought out companies he liked and asked to work with them. Now his clients range from Brew Dog, with storefronts in Sheffield, London, and Birmingham, to smaller breweries, like Rock Leopard.

      “I like to work with people whose beer I’ve tried and I like,” Ryan explains. “Certain clients will be right for me and I’ll know they’re right.’
  </p>
  <p>
  Two years later, Ryan has clients all over the UK and some worldwide. But his work for craft breweries is primarily focused in England.
  </p>
  <p>
  “The craft beer industry is booming. I love beer and I love art,” Ryan says. “Because the craft beer scene is very art driven…every can is really brightly coloured or they’ve got crazy illustrations on there,”
  </p>
  <p>
  It’s a great way to get my artwork into something else I love.”

      The map above shows a number of breweries that work with Lewis Ryan and use his art on their lables or merchandise.

  </p>

</p>
<p>
Commissions for Ryan can go a number of ways. Sometimes, a client will give him a list of requirements for what he’s designing. For example, his drawing for Sheffield Beer Week asked him to show women in brewing.
</p>
<p>
The drawing, which can be seen in the cover below as well as some following photos, also included nods to various breweries around South Yorkshire. The original, seen in the background, will be auctioned off by Sheffield Beer Week, with proceeds going to a charity of their choosing.

    <p>
But sometimes a client may give Ryan a blank slate of sorts.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes they’ll have a beer name and tha’ll be a starting  point, sometimes they don’t have anything at all and I”ll have free reign,” Says Ryan. “It’s cool when I get free reign because I get to be more creative.”
</p>
<p>
In whatever way his commissions are directed, all of his works begin as rough sketches. These expand into more detailed drawings, which are then scanned to become digital works. These can then be coloured and crafted into the final products people see on cans and cases.

Currently Ryan uses Instagram and other social media to showcase his artwork and find other clients. But while Instagram provides a worldwide audience, the expanding industry of craft breweries in Sheffield and elsewhere in England helps build a great repetoir for him as an artist.
</p>
<p>
‘I’d rather be in a gallery as an artist than as a graphic designer,’ says ryan, and the work with various breweries, “Gets my name out there as an artist.’

Ryan explains how the small, individual personalities of each brewery are what make them strong businesses. Their uniqueness gives them a recongnisable personality, and unique artwork and designs can help to further define that brand.
</p>
<p>
Says Ryan, ‘To me, the artwork is just as strong as the beer itself.”
</p>



Ryan feels that the craft beer industry in England is only going to continue to expand. The art community may grow along with it.
</p>
<p>
Ryan hopes that local craft breweries continue to use local art and work with local artists to build their brand. Recognisable art on cans, t shirts, and posters can help draw more people to the breweries and their products.
</p>
<p>
“My challenge with the artwork is getting people to try new beer based on the artwork,” says Ryan. “And then if they like the beer aftewards they’ll come back to it…my job is that initial thing of grabbing someone and saying ‘look at me.’”
</p>

<p>
Ryan explains that the use of the artwork is important for the artist as well, as it gives them their own advertising.
</p>
<p>
“When people start seeing your artwork it starts to spread out,” “breweres talk to each other, so once you get in to one it will spread to another.”
</p>
<p>
Ryan hopes that as some of the craft breweries grow in the industry, they’ll move towards merchandising and branding, as it will assist both the brewery and the artists they work with.
</p>
<p>
But Ryan acknowledges that many of these breweries are still just starting out. Their small size at the current time keeps them from expanding into some areas of branding.
</p>
<p>
“They’re still growing, but so is the industry,” He says.
</p>
<p>
